# Encrpytion Techniques Course

This project is for school project where students needed to implement encryption techniques. And configure them properly.
IE. AES should use Block Chipher Mode. 

There is known issue with the implementation when encrpyting and opening .PDF -files. For some reason the figures in the PDF-file stays scrambled.
